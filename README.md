# LGCloi 

This repository contains the code and assets for a sample Robot (Ego vehicle) for use with SVL Simulator.

The LGCloi robot is an example 3D model of an indoor and outdoor robot that can be used for Robotics development. You can test this robot with our sample 3D indoor environment like [LGSeocho](https://wise.svlsimulator.com/maps/profile/26546191-86e8-4b53-9432-1cecbbd95c87).

The LGCloi robot model has been derived from [CloiSim](https://github.com/lge-ros2/cloisim) project using resources from [sample_resources](https://github.com/lge-ros2/sample_resources).
